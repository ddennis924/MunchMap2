## Why Munch Map?

My friends and I are extremely indecisive, and have trouble deciding where to eat;
we often spend more time deciding than actually eating. To further complicate things, 
as cash-strapped university students, price is a very important issue for us. This app is created to make finding
where to eat as simple and convenient as possible. Munch Map by recommending only the highest rated or anticipated restaurants 
based on user preferences, eliminating the arduous process of choosing a place to eat.
